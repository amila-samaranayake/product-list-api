2. Open the source via a code editor or cmd
3. Run `npm install`
4. Next step is to build the project with typescript (`npm install` will install all the modules including Typescript Compiler (tsc), If you are having issues with Typescript compiler please try to install it globally `npm install -g typescript` ) 
`npm run build` this will create `./dist` directory. `./dist` folder is git ignored.
